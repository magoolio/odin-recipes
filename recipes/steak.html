    <h1>Pan-Seared Steak</h1>
        <img src="../images/steak.jpeg" alt="Pan-seared steak">
            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>If you're making steaks inside, you've come to the right place. This technique for cooking steak in a cast iron skillet is unbeatable. 
                    What sets it apart? It starts on the stove in a cast iron skillet, but you'll finish 
                    the steak in the oven. The stovetop-to-oven method produces steaks with a deeply caramelized crust and a tender, 
                    perfectly cooked interior.</p>
                <p>The skillet is the star of the show. Why? Cast iron absorbs and retains heat like no other surface. It heats up fast and cooks evenly. 
                    A hot cast iron skillet puts a quick sear on steaks, creating a beautiful caramelized crust, 
                    without overcooking the center of the steak. Also, the cast iron skillet goes from stovetop to oven with ease.</p>
                <p>This recipe calls for beef top-sirloin steaks. Choose steaks that are at least 1-inch thick. If the steak is too thin, the inside 
                    will overcook before the beautiful caramelized crust can form on the outside. Of course, this stovetop-to-oven technique works well 
                    for 
                    more expensive cuts, too.</p>

                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>2 (6 ounce) beef top sirloin steaks</li>
            <li>2 cups orange juice</li>
            <li>1 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>½ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons steak seasoning (such as Fiesta Brand® Uncle Chris'), or to taste</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
                <li>sea salt to taste</li>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>  

        <ol>
          <li>Place steaks side by side in large casserole dish. Add orange juice, cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Marinate, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 45 minutes.</li>
          <li>Remove casserole dish from refrigerator. Cover steaks with plastic wrap and let allow to come to room temperature, at least 15 minutes.</li>
          <li>Place steaks on a clean work surface and generously rub with steak seasoning and black pepper.</li>
          <li>Heat olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat.</li>
          <li>Cook steaks in the hot skillet until lightly browned on the bottom, 2 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side and red in the center, about 2 minutes more. Transfer skillet with the steaks to the oven.</li>
          <li>Bake in the preheated oven until steaks are firm and reddish-pink to lightly pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read from 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove steaks from oven; season with salt. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
      </ol>
